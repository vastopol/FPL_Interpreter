load a file && execute
//--------------------------------------

FP_REPL supports scripting of system commands and evaluations.
repl scripts need to end with file extention ".fps"

scripts are lists of statements to be performed in sequence
files are structrued in procedural order.
each statement should end with a terminating symbol ';'
reads in each line, constructs a string, queues string in buffer


OPERATIONS:
//==========================================================================

load file.fps == loads the contents of file.fps into the system buffer

run == execute content of the system buffer. if buffer is empty will not work.
    system buffer is a queue of commands to be executed in order. each command is executed, 
    and removed from the queue. continues until queue is empty.

//==========================================================================

FP_REPL script file format

each statement must end with an ';'
proper structure: define functions, let variables, then have operations

def FUNCTIONS
let ELEMENTS/SEQUENCES
any system commands
evaluation '#'
