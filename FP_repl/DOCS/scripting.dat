load a file && execute
//--------------------------------------

FP_REPL supports scripting of system commands and evaluations.
repl scripts need to end with file extention ".fpl"

scripts are lists of statements to be performed in sequence
files are structrued in procedural order.
reads until newline, constructs a string, queues string in buffer

the '#' is comment, it and everything after will be ignored until newline


OPERATIONS:
//==========================================================================

load file.fpl == load the contents of "file.fpl" into the system buffer

run == execute content of the system buffer. if buffer is empty will not work.
    system buffer is a queue of commands to be executed in Sequential order. 
    each command is executed, and removed from the queue. continues until queue is empty.
    
    note: after run, system buffer will contain content of loads unless explicit call to "bufdump"

//==========================================================================

FP_REPL script file format

proper structure: define functions, let variables, then have operations
use '#' for comments as needed

def FUNCTIONS
let ELEMENTS/SEQUENCES
any system commands
evaluation EXPRESSIONS
