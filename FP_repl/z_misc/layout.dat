SYSCOM:
"syscom.h" is a set of functions which are responsible for the basic user interactions with the memory and system.
The simple routines are handled by the function "com" which, if a string does not match one of the arguments,
it passes control to another function, "exec" which handles memory management and input errors. "exec" handles adding to, removing from,
and printing the contents of the Memory object.

Syscom call:
def -> add
rm -> remove
ls -> print

Memory operations:
add_element(x);
add_sequence(x);
remove_element(x);
remove_sequence(x);
print_elements()
print_sequences()

Pattern (compositional object) which will contain:
* std::string (user input)
* Memory object pointer (variable container)
* Node object pointer (root of abstract syntax tree)
* Interpreter object pointer (parsing)
* Action object pointer (executing)

On construction Pattern is initialized with an input string and a reference to the Memory object.
The Node pointer will initially be NULL.
