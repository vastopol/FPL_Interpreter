# FP_Interpreter
Programming for an Integer based sequence manipulation language.
### For more information see:
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FP_(programming_language)
* http://www.math.bas.bg/bantchev/place/fp.html

### Installation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/vastopol/FP_Interpreter.git

$ cd FP_repl

$ make

$ bin/fplr
```

### Development Goals:
* Simple REPL `->` `fplr`
* Interpreter (not started)

These goals explore:
the deveolpment and design of software, the abstract syntax and paridigms of programming langauges, manipulation of data structures, 
recursive programming techinques, interpretation of code, etc...

### Syntax (primer)
FP language based:
Some of the syntax has been changed, other features have been modified also for ease of use. 
For comprehensive docomentation of the syntax see "DOCS/syntax.dat".
This will show some of the more important basics of FP_REPL interaction. 
such as...
