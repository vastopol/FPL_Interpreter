# FP_Interpreter
A functional programming language based Interpreter for integer sequence manipulation.
The REPL is the interface to the memory management system and the interpreter.
The REPL has primitive capabilities for simple automation of tasks through writing scripts.
The REPL is called `fplr`, which stands for: Functional Programming Language REPL.
The file extension for script files is `.fpl`.

## Version 1.2 Update in progress

### Syntax
For comprehensive documentation of the syntax see "DOCS/syntax.txt".
This will show some of the more important basics of interaction.

### Purpose and Goals:
These goals explore:
Development and design of system level software, manipulation of complex data structures, recursive programming techniques, formal language theory, interpretation of code,
parser construction, etc...
