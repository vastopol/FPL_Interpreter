Scripting
loading && executing files
//-------------------------


FP_REPL supports scripting of system commands and expression evaluations.
Repl scripts need to end with file extention ".fpl"

scripts are lists of statements to be performed in sequential order.
files should be structrued in a well defined procedural order.
input reads until newline, constructs a string, queues string in buffer.

the '#' is comment, it and everything after will be ignored until newline

files can be included in other files.
The variable space and the buffer have different dumps SO the variables can be dumped by a running script.


OPERATIONS:
//==========================================================================

load file.fpl == load the contents of "file.fpl" into the system buffer

run == execute content of the system buffer. if buffer is empty will not work.
       system buffer is a queue of commands to be executed in sequential order. 
       each command is executed, and removed from the queue. continues until queue is empty.

FP_REPL script file formating

define functions, let variables, then have operations
use '#' for comments as needed

def  FUNCTIONS
let  ELEMENTS/SEQUENCES
call SYSCOMS
eval EXPRESSIONS
