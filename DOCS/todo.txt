TODO - Unfinished works


ver 1.2

* possible logic functions
    universals:
        id  = identity
    bools:
        elm = ? is element
        seq = ? is sequence
        nil = ? is empty sequence
        lt  = less than
        gt  = greater than
        eq  = equal to
        lte = less than or equal
        gte = greater than or equal
        neq = not equal

* func.h/cpp -> add more functions for the vm fn_pointers from the math.h library

* fix gentree so it can print out (+,-,*,/%)

* combine let and set

* change how process searches for strings to match
    cant name variables similarly to commands
    handles the string splitting badly

* the trim_space function doesn't handle tabs

* Ctrl-D will crash command line in endless loop

* refactor code and documentation

* UPDATE USER PROGRAMS AFTER CHANGES SO THEY STILL WORK

DONE:
* add the fcts command
* rename ls -> mem
* rename dump -> memdump
* rename bufls -> buf
* add safety checks to div and mod by 0
* add a history command
* add step command to execute top instruction in buffer
* add write command to append a line to buffer

//=============================================

ver 1.3

* add the operators name{args} format part
    map{f}
    red{f}
    filt{p}
    insert{i;x}
    del{i}
    app{x}
    ccf{f1;...;fn}
    if{p;x1;x2}

//=============================================

etc...

* convert all to floating point
