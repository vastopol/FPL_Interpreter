TODO

ver 1.21

* improve parser functionality to overcome limitations
    might have to pass parser to exec to handle more complex operator usage cases

* implement ccf{},ins{},del{},red{} (special cases of existing functionality)

* have @ for rhs argument reference inside the operators

* func.h/cpp -> add more functions for the vm fn_pointers from the math.h library - pow, ...

* rename sequence to list and element to int for clarity

* inconsistencies with throwing exceptions or print error message and return in syscom.cpp
    should go through and convert all error printing returning code to actual exception throwing

* rewrite Makefile so less complex and ugly
* go through and remove unnecessary include statements, old inaccurate comments, other cruft...
* restructure the .cpp files so functions are defined in same order as declared in header files

* refactor code and update documentation

* UPDATE AND CHECK ALL USER PROGRAMS AFTER CHANGES SO THEY STILL WORK

----------------------------------------

etc... maybe???

* convert all to floating point
* consider merging the syscom commands into interpreter functions
* perhaps latex documentation

----------------------------------------

actual ideas

def _sum  = red{+}
def _prod = red{*}
def alt_sum  = red{-}
def alt_prod = red{/}
def _sum_squares = red{+}.map{square}
def abs = if{lt:<@,0>;neg:@;@}

potential ideas

let l = <...>
let l_avg1 = /:<sum:l,size:l>
let l_avg2 = /.app{size:l}.list.sum:l
